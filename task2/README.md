The script `transform.sh` is a Bash script that lowers the MLIR file containing linalg ops to affine and performs loop unrolling using a series of transformation passes. Below is an explanation of each pass used in the command:

### 1. `--linalg-bufferize`
This pass converts Linalg operations from a tensor-based representation to a buffer-based representation. It prepares the operations for further transformations by transitioning from high-level abstractions to lower-level memory-based operations.

### 2. `--func-bufferize`
This pass performs bufferization at the function level. It ensures that function arguments and results are converted from tensors to buffers, enabling compatibility with lower-level transformations.

### 3. `--convert-linalg-to-affine-loops`
This pass lowers Linalg operations into affine loop nests. Affine loops are a structured representation of loops with predictable memory access patterns, which are easier to optimize.

### 4. `--affine-loop-unroll`
This pass applies loop unrolling to affine loops. Loop unrolling is an optimization technique that duplicates the loop body multiple times to reduce loop overhead and improve performance by increasing instruction-level parallelism.
